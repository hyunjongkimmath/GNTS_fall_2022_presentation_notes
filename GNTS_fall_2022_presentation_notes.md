# Outline
- Configuration spaces and Hurwitz spaces
	- Configuration spaces parameterize distinct points in a space.
	- Hurwitz spaces parameterize tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$.
	- There are many variants of either type of space.
	- One main idea [[#^Idea|is]] an application of class field theory - the rational points of a certain class of Hurwitz schemes (constructed based on an abelian $\ell$-group $A$) roughly correspond to surjections from class groups/Jacobians of hyperelliptic covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ to a $A$.
- Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland's Cohen Lenstra result
	- The proportion of imaginary quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ whose class group has $\ell$-part isomorphic to a fixed nontrivial abelian $\ell$-group is proportional to $\frac{1}{|A|}$
	- One can reduce the problem of determining this proportion to counting the number of surjections from class groups of various extensions into $A$.
- Ellenberg-Li-Shusterman's bound on the proportion of hyperelliptic zeta functions that vanish at a fixed number
	- The proportion of zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$ vanishing at a fixed number $s = \frac{1}{2} + it$ is asymptotically $0$.
	- If $\zeta_C(s)$ vanishes at $s$, then there are nontrivial surjections $J_C[\ell](\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q) \to \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ which are $a$-eigenvectors of $\operatorname{Frob}_q$.

# Configuration spaces of $\mathbb{A}^1$ or $\mathbb{P}^1$ and Hurwitz spaces of tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$

---
## Configuration spaces

Let **[$D$](ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_notation_D_closed_disc)** denote a closed disc in $\mathbb{C}$ with a marked point $*$ in the boundary. Let **$\operatorname{Conf}_n$** be the configuration space of $n$ unordered, distinct points in the interior of a closed disc. More precisely, ^e4f62a

$$\operatorname{Conf}_n := \{\{P_1,\ldots,P_n\} \in D^n: P_i \neq P_j \text{ for all } i \neq j\}.$$ ^5bd2db

The above configuration is quite topological; there is also an algebraic version of this configuration space. If we topologically identify the (open) disc as $\mathbb{A}^1_\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C} - \{\infty\}$, then we would want the analogue of $\operatorname{Conf}_n$ to be the configuration space of $\mathbb{A}^1$. 

---

To construct this configuration space, we first construct the configuration space **[$\mathsf{Conf}'_{n+1}$](ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_notation_Conf_n_prime_moduli_space_of_squarefree_degree_n_divisors_on_P1)** of $\mathbb{P}^1$ of $n+1$ (unordered, distinct) points. We construct this configuration space $\mathsf{Conf}'_{n+1}$ as an open subscheme of projective $n$-space $\mathbb{P}^n$ with projective coordinates $a_0:a_1:\cdots:a_{n+1}$. A point $[a_0:a_1:\cdots:a_{n+1}]$ of $\mathsf{Conf}'_{n+1}$ parameterizes a binary form/homogeneous polynomial/divisor $a_0X^n + a_1 X^{n-1} W + \cdots + a_{n+1} W^{n+1}$. To ensure that the zeros of this homogeneous polynomial do not have any repeated roots, we require that the discriminant **$\Delta([a_0:a_1:\cdots:a_{n+1}]) = \Delta(\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} a_i X^{n+1-i} W^i)$** does not vanish. To summarize, 

$$\mathsf{Conf}'_{n+1} := \{[a_0:\cdots:a_{n+1}] : \Delta([a_0:\cdots:a_{n+1}]) \neq 0\}$$ ^3699d2

Now we can construct the configuration space **[$\mathsf{Conf}_n$](ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_notation_Conf_n_moduli_of_n_points_of_A1)** as the closed subscheme of $\mathsf{Conf}'_{n+1}$ cut out by $a_0 = 0$[^3]. As desired, the points of $\mathsf{Conf}_n$ are exactly the degree $n$ (squarefree) divisors of $\mathbb{A}^1$[^2]. ^626c34

[^2]: To see this, note that a point $[a_0:\cdots:a_{n+1}]$ is a point of $\mathsf{Conf}_n$ if and only if $a_0 \neq 0$, i.e. the corresponding divisor $a_1X^{n} W + \cdots + a_{n+1} W^{n+1}$ contains/vanishes at $\infty = [X=1: W=0]$. Furthermore, squarefree divisors of $\mathbb{A}^1$ of degree $n$ bijectively correspond to squarefree divisors of $\mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $n+1$ containing $\infty$.
[^3]: We can alternatively construct $\mathsf{Conf}_n$ as the open subscheme of $\mathsf{Conf}'_n$ via the embedding map $[a_0 = 0: a_1 \cdots : a_{n}] \mapsto [a_1:\cdots:a_{n}]$.

Note that $\mathsf{Conf}'_{n+1}$ and $\mathsf{Conf}_n$ can both be constructed as schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$.


## Tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$

Let $G$ denote a finite group. ^31394f

>[!Definition]
> Let $k$ be a field. A **tame $G$-cover of $\mathbb{P}^1$** is a triple $(X, f, \phi)$ where
>  
> - $X$ is a smooth proper geometrically connected curve $X / k$;
> - $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is **tame**: that is, there exists a reduced divisor $D$ on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ such that $f$ is [[foag_ 12.6.2|Ã©tale]] over $\mathbb{P}^{1}-D$, and such that the ramification of $f$ over each [[foag_ 9.5.1|geometric point]] of $D$ is nontrivial and prime to the characteristic of $k$;
> - $f$ is **[[milne_ec_galois_morphism_of_schemes|Galois]]**: that is, $\operatorname{Aut}(f)$ acts transitively on the [[foag_ 9.5.1#Geometric fiber|geometric fibers]] of $f$;
> - $\phi$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to $\operatorname{Aut}(f)$.

#_meta/TODO change this definition to use [[romagny_wewers_ 2.1]] - the definition in EVW donly considers curves over $k$, whereas Romagny and Wewers' definition considers curves over general schemes.

>[!Example]
> Any hyperelliptic cover of $\mathbb{P}^1$ outside of characteristic $2$ is a tame $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-cover.

## Hurwitz spaces

[[_reference_romagny_wewers|Romagny and Wewers]] [Romagny and Wewers, [[romagny_wewers_4.11 Theorem|Theorem 4.11]], [[romagny_wewers_2.1 Theorem|Theorem 2.1]]] construct a coarse moduli scheme **[${H}_{G,n}$](ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_notation_H_G_n_moduli_of_tame_G_covers_of_P1)**[^4] for the functor of tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ with branch locus of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{P}^1$[^5]. This scheme is smooth and finite type over $\mathbb{Z}$. If $G$ is center free, then ${H}_{G,n}$ is a fine moduli scheme, see [[romagny_wewers_2.2 Corollary|[Romagny and Wewers, Corollary 2.2] ]]. ^a6e475

[^4]: Romagny and Wewers denote this scheme as $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_{n,G,\mathbb{Z}}$.
[^5]: Ellenberg, Venkatesh, and Westerland, [[ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_page_31|only require]] ${H}_{G,n}$ as a scheme over $\mathbb{Z}[1/|G|]$.

There is also a finite etale morphism 

$$\begin{align*}
\pi: {H}_{G,n} &\to \mathsf{Conf}'_n / \operatorname{Spec} R \\
(f: C \to \mathbb{P}^1) &\mapsto (\text{branch locus of } f)
\end{align*}$$

>[!Remark]
>[[ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_ 2.2|There is]] a topological analogue of this Hurwitz scheme. One can construct **[$\operatorname{Hur}_{G,n}$](ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_notation_Hur_G_n)** as $\widetilde{\operatorname{Conf}}_n \times_{B_n} \operatorname{Hom}(\pi, G)$ where 
>- $\widetilde{\operatorname{Conf}}_n$ is the universal cover of $\operatorname{Conf}_n$
>- **$B_n = \pi_1(\operatorname{Conf}_n, c_n)$** is the **Artin Braid group** where $c_n = \{P_1,\ldots,P_n\}$ is a fixed basepoint for $\operatorname{Conf}_n$.
>- **$\pi = \pi_1(\Sigma, *)$** where $\Sigma := D - \{P_1,\ldots,P_n\}$ is the punctured unit disc; note that $\operatorname{Hom}(\pi, G) \cong G^n$ since $\pi$ is the free group generated by the homotopy classes of basic loops $\gamma_i$ going around only $P_i$  counterclockwise.
> - $\times_{B_n}$ is the Borel construction of spaces with $B_n$-actions; $B_n$ acts on $\pi$ by "braiding" the punctures around and thus $B_n$ acts on the (discrete, finite) space $\operatorname{Hom}(\pi, G)$.
> 
 > In particular, there is a natural covering map $\operatorname{Hur}_{G,n} \to \operatorname{Conf}_n$. 
 > 
 > Fixing a point $\tilde{c}_n$ over $c_n$, the fiber of this covering map above $c_n$ can be identified with the set $\operatorname{Hom}(\pi, G) \cong G^n$. One can show that the points in this fiber correspond to (isomorphism classes of) [[bredon_ 6.6_page_149|regular]][^7] covering maps $Y \to \Sigma$ whose automorphism/deck transformation group is a subgroup of $G$. The fibral point corresponding to $(g_1,\ldots,g_n) \in G^n$ is the $\langle g_1,\ldots,g_n \rangle$-cover $Y \to \Sigma$ whose [[bredon_ 4.6_page_145_5|monodromy]] by $\gamma_i$ is $g_i$[^6].  

[^6]: Monodromy refers to the monodromy action - the action of $\pi = \pi_1(\Sigma, *)$ on the fiber of the base point under the covering map $Y \to \Sigma$. Since the covering is regular, $\pi_1(\Sigma, *)$ surjects onto the automorphism group of this covering; the monodromy by $\gamma_i$ is the image of $\gamma_i$ under this surjection.
[^7]: i.e. the deck transformation group acts transitively on fibers

There are variants of the Hurwitz scheme $H_{G,n}$. In particular, there exist Hurwitz schemes 
- **[$\mathsf{Hn}_{G,n}$](ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_notation_Hn_G_n_disjoint_union)**, which parameterizes tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ whose branch loci over $\mathbb{A}^1$ are of degree $n$ (in particular, there may or may not be ramification over $\infty$, and hence the branch locus over $\mathbb{P}^1$ has degree either $n$ or $n+1$). ^8a6b79
-  **[$\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$](ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_notation_Hn_G_n_c_moduli_of_tame_G_covers_with_monodromy_of_type_c)**, which parameterizes tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ whose branch loci over $\mathbb{A}^1$ are of degree $n$ and whose monodromy is of type $c$, where $c$ is a rational union of conjugacy classes in $G$. ^74e6ce

The definitions or monodromy type and rational union of conjugacy classes are in order:

>[!Definition]
>Let $G$ be a finite group. A union $c$ of conjugacy classes (or equivalently, a subset of $G$ that is preserved under conjugation) is called **rational** if $g^N \in c$ for all $g \in c$ and $N$ relatively prime to $G$.

> [!Remark]
> In general, $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$ is a subscheme of $\mathsf{Hn}_{G,n}$. We can [[email_rationality_of_conjugacy_invariant_subset_in_EVW|in fact construct]] $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ (of characteristic prime to $|G|$) even if $c$ is not a rational union of conjugacy classes as long as $g^q \in c$ for all $g \in c$. Let us say that **$c$ is an $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational union of conjugacy classes** in this case. In this case, the approaches of Ellenberg, Venkatesh, and Westerland's work (as well as those in Ellenberg, Li, and Shusterman work) continue to apply.
> See also [[#^f33a6c|a later remark in these notes]].

^ae5f54

> [!Definition]
> Let $f: X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be a tame $G$-cover over a field $k$. We say that $f$ has **monodromy of type $c$** if the images of fixed generators of the tame inertia groups at each branch point of $f$ lie in $c$.

The case of interest is $G = A \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, where $A$ is a finite abelian $\ell$-group (where $\ell$ is an odd prime), $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $A$ by involution, and $c$ is the conjugacy class consisting of all involutions.

> [!Idea]
> [[#^0c47f3|Roughly]] [[#^c61bc6|speaking]], the $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$ correspond to surjections of the $\ell$-part of the class group to $A$ or to surjections of the ($\ell$-torsion of the) Jacobian to $A$ which are fixed under $\operatorname{Frob}_q$.


# Results of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland and Ellenberg-Li-Shusterman


## Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland's Cohen-Lenstra result for function fields

> [!Definition]
> A quadratic extension of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ is **imaginary** if it is ramified at $\infty$.
> [[randal-williams_cl_imaginary_quadratic_extension_of_F_q_t|Equivalently]], a quadratic extension $L \supset K$ is imaginary if it is of the form $\mathbb{F}_q(t)(\sqrt{f(t)})$ for some squarefree polynomial $f$ of odd degree.

^0bf5b8

> [!Remark]
> Note that quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$  correspond to double covers of $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{F}_q}$, i.e. hyperelliptic curves. By the [[foag_ 19.5.1|hyperelliptic Riemann-Hurwitz formula]], such a double cover has branch degree $2g+2$, where $g$ is the genus of the curve. For an imaginary hyperelliptic curve with function field $L = \mathbb{F}_q(t)(\sqrt{f(t)})$ with $f(t)$ a polynomial of odd degree $n$, we have that $n + 1 = 2g+2$, so $g = \frac{n-1}{2}$.

Ellenberg, Venkatesh, and Westerland proved the following Cohen-Lenstra result:

> [!Theorem]
> Let $\ell>2$ be prime and $A$ a nontrivial finite abelian $\ell$-group. Write $\delta^{+}(q)$(resp. $\delta^{-}(q)$) for the [[randal-williams_cl_imaginary_quadratic_extension_of_F_q_t|upper density]] (resp. [[randal-williams_cl_imaginary_quadratic_extension_of_F_q_t#Upper and lower densities of the Cohen-Lenstra heuristic|lower density]]) of [[randal-williams_cl_imaginary_quadratic_extension_of_F_q_t|imaginary quadratic extensions]] of $\mathbb{F}_{q}(t)$ for which the $\ell$-part of the class group is isomorphic to $A$.  ^94e900
>
> Then $\delta^{+}(q)$ and $\delta^{-}(q)$ converge, as $q \rightarrow \infty$ with $q \neq 1(\bmod \ell)$, to $\frac{\Pi_{i>1}\left(1-\ell^{-i}\right)}{|\operatorname{Aut}(A)|}$. ^f2c1ed

> [!Definition]
> Fix a prime $\ell > 2$. The upper and lower densities **$\delta^+(q)$** and **$\delta^-(q)$** (which are really dependent on $A$ as well) are more precisely defined as follows:
> 
> - Let $\mathfrak{S}_n$ denote the set of isomorphism classes of imaginary quadratic extensions $L \supset \mathbb{F}_q(t)$ of discriminant degree $n+1$[^9] (where $n$ is odd).
>
> - Let $\iota: \mathfrak{S}_n \to \{0,1\}$ be given by 
> $$\iota(L) = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if } \operatorname{Cl} (\mathcal{O}_L)_\ell \cong A \\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
>
> - Define 
> $$\delta^+(q) := \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sum_{L \in \mathfrak{S}_n} \iota(L)}{|\mathfrak{S}_n|} \quad \text{and} \quad \delta^-(q) := \liminf_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sum_{L \in \mathfrak{S}_n} \iota(L)}{|\mathfrak{S}_n|}$$

^f7b00f

[^9]: The discriminant degree should refer to the branch locus degree of the double cover $C \to \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ corresponding to $L/\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. In this case, the double cover should be branched at $\infty$ and have $n$ additional branches (for a total of $n+1$ branches).

Intuitively, the theorem says that the proportion of imaginary quadratic extensions $L$ of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ such that $(\operatorname{Cl} \mathcal{O}_L)_\ell \cong A$ is proportional to $\frac{1}{|\operatorname{Aut}(A)|}$ (the factor of $\prod_{i > 1}(1 - \ell^{-i})$ is present so that the the sum of these proportions over all (isomorphism classes of) finite abelian $\ell$-groups is $1$).

### Reducing this Cohen-Lenstra problem into a problem of bounding rational points in a Hurwitz scheme 

Let **$\mathcal{L}$** denote the set of isomorphism classes of finite abelian $\ell$-groups. Let **$\mu$** denote the **Cohen-Lenstra distribution**, i.e. the probability distribution on $\mathcal{L}$ sending $A$ to $\prod_{i \geq 1} (1-\ell^{-i}) |\operatorname{Aut}(A)|^{-1}$. In other words, the [[#^f2c1ed|theorem]] states that, for a nontrivial finite abelian $\ell$-group $A$, the proportion of imaginary quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ whose class groups have $\ell$-part isomorphic to $A$ is given by $\mu(A)$. ^b7a5e1

\[Ellenberg, Venkatesh, and Westerland, [[ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_ 8.2|Lemma 8.2]], [[ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_ 8.3|Proposition 8.3]], [[ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_ 8.4|Lemma 8.4]]\] show that $\mu$ is roughly characterized as the probability distribution on $\mathcal{L}$ such that, for any fixed $A \in \mathcal{L}$, the expected value of the counting function $\mathcal{L} \to \mathbb{N}, \quad A' \mapsto \#\operatorname{Sur}(A',A)$ is (close to) $1$. 

Using such ideas, [[ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_ 8.8#Implies the main theorem|they show]] that it suffices to show that the fraction $\frac{\sum_{L \in \mathfrak{S}_n} \# \operatorname{Sur}(\mathcal{O}_L, A)}{|\mathfrak{S}_n|}$ is close to $1$[^8].

[^8]: In fact, [[ellenberg_venkatesh_westerland_ 8.8|they show that]] there exists a constant $B(A)$ such that 
	$$
	\left|\frac{\sum_{L \in \mathfrak{S}_{n}} m_{A}(L)}{\left|\mathfrak{S}_{n}\right|}-1\right| \leq B(A) / \sqrt{q}
	$$
	for all $n, q$ with $\sqrt{q}>B(A)$ and $n$ an odd integer greater than $B(A)$.

To finally reduce the Cohen-Lenstra problem to a point-bounding problem, we correspond the points of a Hurwitz scheme to the sum $\sum_{L \in \mathfrak{S}_n} \# \operatorname{Sur}(\mathcal{O}_L, A)$:

> [!Proposition]
> Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field , let $\ell \nmid q$ be an odd prime. Fix $A$ to be a nontrivial finite abelian $\ell$-group. Let $G = A \rtimes (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$, where $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $A$ by inversion. Let $c$ be the conjugacy class in $G$ consisting of all involutions. Let $n$ be an odd integer.
> 
> Consider the scheme $\mathsf{Hn}_{G,n}^c$ as a scheme over $\mathbb{F}_q$.
> 
> There is a bijection between $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n} (\mathbb{F}_q)$ and the set of isomorphism classes of pairs $(L,\alpha)$, where
> - $L$ is an [[#^0bf5b8|imaginary quadratic extension]] of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ of discriminant degree $n+1$[^9] and 
> - $\alpha$ is a surjective homomorphism $\alpha: \operatorname{Cl} \mathcal{O}_L \to A$.
> 
> Two pairs $(L,\alpha)$ and $(L', \alpha')$ are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism $f: L \to L'$ over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ such that $f^* \alpha' = \alpha$.

^0c47f3

This proposition then implies that 

$$\sum_{L \in \mathfrak{S}_n} \# \operatorname{Sur}(\mathcal{O}_L, A) = 2 |\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}(\mathbb{F}_q)|.$$

One can also count $\#\mathfrak{S}_n$ as $2(q^n-q^{n-1})$[^10]. Showing the theorem then reduces to showing that $\frac{\#\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}(\mathbb{F}_q)}{q^n}$ is close to $1$.

[^10]: This is true because the number of squarefree polynomials of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^n-q^{n-1}$ and because fields $\mathbb{F}_q(t)(\sqrt{f_1(t)})$ and $\mathbb{F}_q(t)(\sqrt{f_2(t)})$ with the same branch loci are isomorphic if and only if $f_1(t)$ and $f_2(t)$ are scalar multiples by an element of $(\mathbb{F}_q^\times)^2$.


> [!Remark]
> We explain why the points of $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n} (\mathbb{F}_q)$ should represent *imaginary* quadratic extensions as opposed to *imaginary or nonimaginary* quadratic extensions.
> 
> Recall that [$\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$](#^74e6ce) is the Hurwitz scheme parameterizing tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ whose branch loci over $\mathbb{A}^1$ are of degree $n$ and whose monodromy is of type $c$. 
> Since $G = A \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, such a cover factors as $C \to H \to \mathbb{P}^1$ where $H \to \mathbb{P}^1$ is a hyperelliptic cover and $C \to H$ is the quotient map $C \to C/A$, which must be unramified everywhere. Thus, the ramification of $C \to \mathbb{P}^1$ must entirely come from $H \to \mathbb{P}^1$. Moreover, since $n$ is odd and since the hyperelliptic cover $C \to \mathbb{P}^1$ must have a branch locus of even degree, there must in fact be ramification over $\infty$ and hence $C \to \mathbb{P}^1$ must be imaginary.

> [!Remark]
> Furthermore, the correspondence requires surjective homomorphisms $\alpha: \operatorname{Cl} \mathcal{O}_L \to A$ along with extensions $L$ due to class field theory - the specific map $\alpha$ corresponds to the etale cover $C \to C/A$ by class field theory.

>[!Remark]
>#_meta/TODO explain why monodromy is $c$.

> [!Remark]
> If $A$ is nontrivial, then $G$ is center free. A consequence of this is that $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$ is a fine moduli scheme, cf. [[#^5be803|the exposition on Hurwitz spaces earlier]].

> [!Remark]
> [[#^ae5f54|As remarked above]], $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$ can be constructed over $\mathbb{F}_q$ because $c$ is an $\mathbb{F}_q$[[#^ae5f54|-rational conjugacy class]] of $G$.

## Ellenberg-Li-Shusterman's result on the proportion of hyperelliptic zeta functions that vanish at a fixed number

Ellenberg, Li, and Shusterman significantly used the machinery of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland to prove that the proportion of hyperellitpic curves over finite fields of a fixed characteristic that vanish at a fixed number is $0$:

> [!Theorem]
> Fix a prime $p$, and a number $s = \frac{1}{2} + it$ for a fixed real number $t$. For a power $q = p^k$, define
> **$$\begin{equation} h_{q,s} := \sup_{g} \frac{\big|\{C \in \mathcal{H}_g(\mathbb{F}_q) : \zeta_C(s) = 0\}\big|}{\big|\mathcal{H}_g(\mathbb{F}_q)\big|}     \end{equation}$$**
> where $\mathcal{H}_g(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the family of genus $g$ hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and where $\zeta_C$ is the zeta function of the hyperelliptic curve $C \in \mathcal{H}_g(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Then
> $$h^{p^k,s} \ll p^{-k/276}$$
> as $k \to \infty$. In particular, $h_{p^k, s} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$.

### Reducing vanishing of the zeta function of a hyperelliptic curve to rational points on Hurwitz schemes

Let **$Q_{n,q}$** denote the set of squarefree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of degree $n$. Let **$J_f$** be the Jacobian of the hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ where $f \in Q_{n,q}$. Let **$P_f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$**[^12] denote the (reverse) characteristic polynomial of (geometric) Frobenius (acting on $\ell$-adic Tate modules). A consequence of the Weil conjectures [[poonen_curves_ 3.7|is that]] ^3ddb78

$$Z_{C_f}(T)=\frac{P_{f}(T)}{(1-T)(1-q T)}$$

where $Z_{C_f}(T)$ is [[poonen_curves_notation_zeta_X_s_zeta_function_of_variety|such that]] $\zeta_{C_f}(s) = Z_{C_f}(q^{-s})$, so the vanishing of $\zeta_{C_f}(s)$ is equivalent to the vanishing of $P_f(q^{-s})$.

[^12]: $P_f(x)$ should coincide with the [$L$-polynomial](https://www.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/av.fq.l-polynomial?timestamp=1567619635899313). In particular, both have zeroes of norm $q^{-1/2}$ and are *not* a monic polynomial but rather the reverse of a monic polynomial. 

For a $q$-Weil number $\alpha$ of weight $1$ ([[ellenberg_li_shusterman_10|i.e.]] an algebraic integer whose absolute values under all complex embeddings equal $\sqrt{q}$) let **$g_{\alpha}(x)$** be its minimal polynomial. Let **$Q^\alpha_{n,q}$** be the subset of $Q_{n,q}$ defined by $\{f \in Q_{n,q} : P_f(\alpha^{-1}) = 0\}$. We want to bound the ratio $\frac{|Q_{n,q}^\alpha|}{|Q_{n,q}|}$.

^42ed7e

With $s = \frac{1}{2} + it$ fixed (so $\alpha = q^{-s}$), use Chebotarev's density theorem (for sufficiently large $k$) to find a prime

$$\ell < \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{q}{4} \right)^{1/276}$$

modulo which $g_{p^s}$ splits completely. In particular, pick $a \in \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}^\times$ so that $g_{p^s}(a) \equiv 0 \pmod{\ell}$[^13].

[^13]: There must be at least one zero of $g_{p^s}$ mod $\ell$  in $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}^\times$ because if all zeroes of $g_{p^s}$ were to reduce to $0$ mod $\ell$, then a power of $q$ would have to be divisible by $\ell$, which cannot happen.

If $P_f(q^{-s}) = 0$, then $P_f(p^{-sk}) = 0$, so $g_{p^{-s}}(x)$ must divide $P_f(x^{-k})$ or equivalently divide $P^{\text{rev}}_f(x^k)$ where $P^{\text{rev}}_f(x^k)$ is the reverse polynomial of $P_f$, i.e. the characteristic polynomial of $\operatorname{Frob}_q$. Reducing mod $\ell$, we had $g_{p^{-s}}(a) \equiv 0 \pmod{\ell}$, so $P_{f}^{\text{rev}}(a^k) \equiv 0 \pmod{\ell}$. This means that $J_f[\ell](\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q)$ has nonzero elements of eigenvalue $a^k$. 

For $a \in \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}^\times$, let **$Q^{a, \ell}_{n,q}$** be the set of $f \in Q_{n,q}$ such that there are nonzero elements $R \in J_f[\ell](\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q)$ with ^fd1a77

$$\operatorname{Frob}_q R = aR$$

where $a \in \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}^\times$. With this notation, we have shown above that $|Q^{q^s}_{n,q}| \leq |Q^{a^k, \ell}_{n,q}|$, so it suffices to bound the ratio $\frac{|Q_{n,q}^{a^k,\ell}|}{|Q_{n,q}|}$.

Now the $a$-eigenspace of $\operatorname{Frob}_q$ on $J_f[\ell](\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q)$ is nontrivial (i.e. $f \in Q_{n,q}$ is in $Q^{a, \ell}_{n,q}$) exactly if the dual space of maps $s: J_f[\ell](\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q) \to \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ in the $a$-eigenspace of $\operatorname{Frob}_q^\vee$ is nontrivial. In turn, this is equivalent to the existence of surjections $s: J_f[\ell](\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q) \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\operatorname{Frob}_q^\vee s = a s$. 

[[#^0c47f3|We previously established]] that $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ corresponds to a set of isomorphism classes of imaginary quadratic extensions $L$ of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ and surjections $\operatorname{Cl} \mathcal{O}_L \to A$. Similarly, the set of surjections $s: \operatorname{Jac}(C)[\ell] \to (\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z})$ is naturally identified with the set of Ã©tale $(\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z})$ covers of $C$, which are tame $G$-covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ where $G = \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, and such covers are points of a Hurwitz scheme. Informally, a surjection $s$ fixed by $\operatorname{Frob}_q$ should correspond to an $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational point of the Hurwitz scheme, and more generally, a surjection $s$ with eigenvalue $a$ should correspond to an $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational point of the "$a$-twist of the Hurwitz scheme". Ellenberg-Li-Shusterman then showed that number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of this twist is asymptotically close to $q^n$, just as for $\mathsf{Hn}^c_{G,n}$. ^c61bc6
